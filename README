Natural Language Processing examples

This project contains a Python, a Perl and an R script plus a simple GNUPlot.

The Python script "estimate-gender.py" tries to pinpoint the gender of a
GERMAN (!) text by applying a couple of word counts - namely pronouns,
adjective, numerals, determiners. Those are word classes which seem to make it
possible to distinguish texts by gender of the writer. 

The Python script requires Python's NLTK framework!

pip install nltk

If you have textfiles, convert them to UTF-8 (iconv) and call

./estimate-gender.py mytextfile

The Perl script generates an automated summary by "tf-idf" and only requires
the module IO::All

cpan IO::All

Call it with your textfile:

./automated-summary.pl mytextfile

The R script generates a "word cloud" by word frequency without GERMAN (!) stopwords.

It requires the R packages tm and wordcloud:

install.packages('tm')
install.packages('wordcloud')

Then source the script on R's REPL:

source('wordcloud.R') and et viola, there pops up your word cloud.
